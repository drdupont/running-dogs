These .html and .css files produce a site that aims to recreate the
work first accomplished on omfgdogs.com. Using CSS, the background
consists of a looped gif image of dogs happily running; further,
CSS is used to style a link to the original site in the bottom corner.
An audio file (playing an upbeat chiptune piece), loops in the
background, using an HTML5 tag.

There were no collaborators on this assignment. It was completed in
approximately 1 hour, consisting mainly of experimenting with
different html tags and css rules.
